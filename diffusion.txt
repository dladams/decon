Diffusion estimates
David Adams
November 2020

The RMS spread in space of signal is

  sig_x = sqrt(2 D t)

where D is the diffusion coefficient and t is the drift time.

For constant drift speed v, the corresponding spread in time

  sig_t = sqrt(2 D t)/v

        = sqrt(2 D x / v) /v

where D is the diffusion coefficient and t is the drift time.
In the second expression x is the drift distance and v is the
drift speed.

For protoDUNE and DUNE with E = 0.5 kV/cm:

  v = 1.60 mm/us = 0.16 cm/us

  D = 5 cm^2/s = 5e-6 cm^s/us

  sig_t = 0.49 sqrt(x)

where the drift distance x is in meters.
